# wccgn-style

Custom Stylesheet for https://cologne.wordcamp.org/2015/, based on the style of WordCamp Hamburg 2014 and the initial style sheet by Tammie Lister.

We use Jetpack's module for Custom Style Sheets which allows to use SASS (.scss) files. The .css file is created to make sure the SASS file compiles without errors, which would break the site layout.
